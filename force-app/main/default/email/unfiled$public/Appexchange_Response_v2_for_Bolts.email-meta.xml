    <subject>Thanks for Your 7Summits&apos; Lightning Bolt Inquiry!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello!

Thank you for your interest in 7Summits&apos; Lightning Bolts on the Salesforce AppExchange. The reason you were not given the complete package upon request is that, despite what AppExchange displays, Lightning Bolt community templates are not free. Our Bolts get you to market faster by consolidating dozens of components and hundreds of development hours into a single install, and they range in price from $10,000 to $100,000.

Before implementing a Lightning Bolt, we should talk to ensure that the solution effectively meets your needs and unlocks business value. If you&apos;d like to take the next step in elevating your digital experience with a Bolt, please respond to this email and a member of our team will reach you promptly.

We look forward to helping you on your digital transformation!
