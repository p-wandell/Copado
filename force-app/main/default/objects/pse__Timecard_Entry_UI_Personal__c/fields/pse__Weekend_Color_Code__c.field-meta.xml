    <description>Given field/config is used to color code Scheduled 0-hour days. On a typical 8-hour/5-day schedule, this would be the weekend days, Saturday and Sunday, but this would work for any days that are explicitly 0 hours in the Schedule Pattern (not Holidays) on the selected Resource&apos;s Work Calendar. Customers could set this to a color (could be different than any color chosen for Holidays) and the date-column heading would be color-coded in the same way, with a legend off to the right showing.</description>
