    <description>Checking this field removes non-essential processing such as filtering out fields that don&apos;t need to be updated.  Leave this unchecked if you only want rollups to be processed where a change was actually made to the source field. However, enabling this setting does not guarantee the limiting of pre-processing, as other conditions can necessitate that pre-processing occurs. Some examples are if the source object is a knowledge article, or the source object has custom formula fields.</description>
